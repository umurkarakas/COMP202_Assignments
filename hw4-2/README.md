Note: In case you are using repl.it, type first "javac *.java" to be able to run HW4.java file

You only need to work on the HW4.java file, but you can also change the Graph.java file if needed
The file containing "test" in the name is only needed for github autograding tests. To see the results of the test open the |Actions| tab
